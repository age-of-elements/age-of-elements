IDEA BEHIND THIS GAME.

I played Abermud a lot, and wanted to do something better (who don't).

1. A wizard can extend the game.

2. The game can be extended on fly, without rebooting the mud.

3. There are no difference between objects. Rooms, players and things
   are just objects.

4. All objects are specified in interpreted C. The specifications are
   compiled (loaded) first time they are referenced.

5. There are no player parser. All commands are defined by the objects.
   For example, the knife defines the command 'wield', and the
   leather jacket defines 'wear'. An object defines a command by
   associating it with a local function, defined in the object. When
   the user types that command, the corresponding function will be called.
   If the user types 'wear jacket', then "jacket" will be sent as an
   argument to the wear function in the jacket object. If the user
   types 'wear plate', the jacket wear function will detect that
   "plate" != "jacket", and return false. Then, another 'wear' command
   is tried, untill success. When the user drops the jacket, all commands
   are removed that was associated with that object.
