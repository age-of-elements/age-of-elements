command: any spell
argument: optional name of a player

Cast a spell. If no argument, then cast spell on current fighting opponent.

Spell		level		Spell points	Max damage

missile		5		10		2 x good
shock		10		15		3 x good
fireball	15		20		4 x good

You have to have enough experience points to be able to use the spells,
but then they will work 100 %.

If you cast a spell on an idle player, a fight will start.
