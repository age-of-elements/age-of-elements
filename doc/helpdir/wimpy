command: wimpy
no arguments.

Toggle wimpy mode. If you are in wimpy mode, your legs will run away
if your hit points goes below one fifth of max.

Default for a new player is brave mode.

This is no secure thing. It might save you, if you have a slow connection,
or slow fingers. Some monsters hack away more than 1/5 of your HP, and you
might find yourself dead without warning. And some monsters runs as
fast as your legs.
