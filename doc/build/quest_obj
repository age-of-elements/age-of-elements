The file obj/quest_obj.c can be cloned when setting up a quest. Look at the
file for initializations. Every wizard may set up one quest. It
must be approved by an arch wizard.

The quests are not supposed to be very dangerous, just some kind of
puzzle to solve. Even very easy quests are good, especially for the
beginners.

The quest object should be initialized into the room room/quest_room. Look
in this room for more documentation.

The quest must be documented how to solve, and with the name of an
archwizard that approved of it.
This documentation should be moved to /players/quests/. 'quests' is not
the name of a player, but this directory is use to make it impossible
for normal players to read the docs. If you have documentation ready
to move, ask an archwizard.
