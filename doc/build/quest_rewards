This is guidelines and recommendations for how to award players when you
make quests or smaller scenarios.

The award should naturally be dependant on the difficulty of the quest, and
this might be very hard to judge objectivly. To faciliate this you can compare
your quest with the examples given here.

The suggested award is given as a pair of numbers. The numbers are
Value of gold, equipment / Total ep given. This award should be given at
two times. First while solving the quest. The second time is when the quest
is completed. The gold should be given not just as coins, but also as
equipment of different kinds.

Major quest:	20000/30000
		Hard to solve, takes about 3-5 hours to finish and requires
		the player to visit about 50-80 rooms.
		Max alignment adjustment: +/- 200

Medium quest:	10000/15000
		Still not easy. Takes about 1-3 hours to finish and requires
		the player to visit about 30-60 rooms.
		Max alignment adjustment: +/- 100

Easy quest:	3000/5000
		Quite easy. Takes about an hour to finish and requires the
		player to visit 10-20 rooms.
		Max alignment adjustment: +/- 50

scenario:	0-5000/0-5000
		Very much like quests, but not registered as such. Because
		of this they don't have to be very hard or require him to
		visit a certain number of rooms. Intended to enhance the
		game and make it more interesting.

Players should only be able to receive rewards once. Use the bit-functions
to make sure of this. If he tries to solve it again, it should either be
impossible or not yield any rewards.
