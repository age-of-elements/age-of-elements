If there are any errors when loading a new file, the object will not
be loaded at all, and you will be thrown out to the void.

To look at the error message, cat or edit the file /log/name, where 'name' is
your name. Check this file regularly, and trim it if big (use rm).

The line number specified by the error can be several lines wrong
sometimes. Sorry for this.

There can also be a run time error, for example if the room tries to
move you to a room that does not exist. Again, look at lpmud.log.
