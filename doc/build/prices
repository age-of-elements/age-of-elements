This is a recommended list of range of prices. As is known, no items
gives more than 1000 coins in any shop.

Items should never be worth more than 5000. An item worth 5000 is an
extremly good item. Only the best of all good items should be worth this
much.

If you have an item that you think should be worth more, than it is too good
and should not exist in the game !

Look at weapon.list and armour.list for examples of values of weapons
and armours.
