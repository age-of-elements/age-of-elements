Congratulations Sir Wizard!

        You have now become an apprentice wizard by reaching level 20. To
become a full wizard (level 21) you need only to talk to Leo. Just tell him
to give you a castle and you're on your way!

        Before you do this you need to ask another wizard to support you. Leo
will ask you for a name and he will not be satisfied until you have one to
give. The obligations of this supporting wizard is simply to help you to get
started and to keep you out of trouble! :)

        Your repertoire of commands have now been extended with some new
wizards commmands. You can get help for those by typeing 'help wizard'
These new powers MUST be used sensibly! From now on you are bound by the rules
that you will find by typing the command 'rules'. Do this as your first action
when you stop reading this text.

        To help you get started there is another file that you can read. It
will introduce you to the new world of Genesis and help you make a workroom
among other things. Read it as soon as you have talked to Leo! The commmand
for doing this is 'more /doc/examples/NEW_WIZ'

                Good luck!
