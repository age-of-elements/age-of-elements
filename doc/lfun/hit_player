int hit_player(dam)
int dam;

If the object can fight and get hit by other objects, it must have
a hit_player function. The "dam" is the maximum damage the other
object wants to give. Return the actual damage.

This function should also tell other players in the current room
that someone got hit (using say()).

See example in player.c.
