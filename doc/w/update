Command: update
Argument: file

Remove the definition of an object. If the object was cloned, all copies
of it will remain. Use full path name if the file is not in your home
directory.

If it is a room, the room will be destroyed. The next refernce of the room
will load it again from the file.

The 'update' command is implemented as an LPC function that simply calls
'destruct()' on the object.
