Command: cat
Argument: file

Print the file 'file'. If it is big, characters will be lost because all of
the file is written to the socket, without delay.

The file will be searched for in the current directory. 'cat castle.c' will
print the castle of the wizard. 'cat' isn't really good for
lookin at game files, but rather better for reading documentation.

Only Arch wizards and higher can read files from other wizards. Files from the
basic adventure can be read by all wizards.
