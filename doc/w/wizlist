Command: wizlist (name)

The wizard top score list.

This is the purpose of the game: To be on the top of this list.
Of course, you have to become wizard first.

A wizard get one point for every command he has defined when it is used
by a player. It is quite easy to cheat, of course, but cheating wizards
are simply removed from the game (and the list).

When you use commands defined by your objects, you will also get points,
but this is legal for normal use.

The score decays with 1 % every reset, and is saved and restored from
file when reboot of game.

If there are many wizards, not all wizlist data is printed. Give name of
wizard as argument if you want to look at a special wizard.

Columns:
1:	Score of the castle.
2:	Score % of total.
3:	Rank sorted by column 1.
4:	Total number of evaluated nodes.
5:	Total number of heart beats.
6:	Experience + money given to players by this wizard.
7:	Total number of indices used in arrays.
