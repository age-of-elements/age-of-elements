Command: load
Argument: file

If the object defined in 'file' isn't loaded, it will be. 'reset()' will
also be called in the object. If the object was loaded, nothing will happen.

This command is implemented by teleporting the wizard to the object, which
will force the object to load, and then teleporting the wizard back again.

Rooms can also be loaded by just walking to them. That has exactly the
same effect.
