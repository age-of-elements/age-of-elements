Command: goto
argument: obj

Teleport directly to a room or a player. If 'obj' is a room, the go to that
room. If 'obj' is a player, then go to the same room as his.

Bugs:

If the player isn't in the game, or the name of the room doesn't exist,
the teleport will fail, and move you into the void.

When teleporting to a player or monster, you will not get a description
of the contents of that room.
