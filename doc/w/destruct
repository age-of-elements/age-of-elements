Command: destruct
Argument: object

If there is an object named "object" in the same room, it can be destroyed
with 'destruct object'. If it is a cloned object, the original blue print will
still remain loaded. If it is a singular object (not cloned), like a castle,
then all data about the object will be discared.

An 'update' of a castle will have the same effect.

Never 'destruct' a player.
