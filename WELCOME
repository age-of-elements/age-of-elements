Welcome to the LPmud 2.4.5 mudlib.

Take a look around and see how LPmud used to look like in its early days.

For basic instructions, simply type 'help' after you logged in and explore
from there. You move by giving directions (e.g. 'north', 'down', 'northwest'
or their abbreviations 'n', 'd', 'nw').

When you want to become a wizard, log out and use a text editor to change your
level in the savefile (players/<yourname>.o) to 25 or higher. If you get bored
with this welcome message, you can write your own in the file /WELCOME.

To log in, enter the name of your game character at the prompt, or just
'guest'. If this is your first time, a new character will be created and you
will be asked a for your password and couple of other things.

Enjoy!
