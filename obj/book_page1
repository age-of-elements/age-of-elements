ADVENTURING.

On later years, it has become more and more complicated to adventure and
gather experience. This book was written to be a guide for adventurers.

As everyone knows, the meaning of life is to gain experience and raise
your level. This can be done here at the adventurers guild, but a small
fee is sometimes required if there is not enough experience.

The best way to get experience is to exterminate bad monsters that stroll
around our city. Experience can also be gained by killing players.

Your reputation will depend on how kind you are. If you kill good players,
you will be regarded as evil. This is not good, because other players
will stay out of your way, and gather together and attack evil players.

The altogether top goal is to become wizard. All wizards will be assigned
a castle, which they can rebuild any way they like.

Note: As this is a glorified version of real life, you better get drunk
if you are hurt. Then, you will heal faster. Never trust privacy. Wizards
has eyes everywhere, which they use to study usage of their castles etc.
