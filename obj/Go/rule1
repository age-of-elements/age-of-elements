There are two players, black and white. They take turns, playing one stone
each. Black starts with one or more stones, depending on the handicap.

The stones are played in a matrix on the intersections. It is allowed to
play on the outer border.

The normal game size is 19 x 19 (that is 18 x 18 squares), but the game
can also be player on smaller boards.
