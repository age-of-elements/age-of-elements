This is the old LP 2.4.5 mudlib, slightly updated to run with LDMud 3.2.7
or newer. LP 2.4.5 is by all means a spartanic, if not to say primitive,
mudlib, but it also is small and easy to understand (not to mention the
historical value :-).

LP 2.4.5 is a compat-mode mudlib, but the provided simul_efun object provides
the necessary functions to let it run with a plain driver as well (just
the old parse_command() efun is not simulated).
For both modes the master object is 'obj/master.c'.

The topdirectory contains these files and directories:

  ACCESS.ALLOW: the usual access definition file
  WELCOME, NEWS, WIZNEWS: the messages printed on login
  WIZLIST     : the wizlist savefile

  doc/        : mudlib-specific documentation, to be complemented
                with the doc/ files from the driver distribution.
  log/        : logfiles generated by the mudlib
  obj/        : game objects
  players/    : player savefiles and wizard directories
  room/       : game rooms and include files
  sys/        : include files, including those from the driver distribution
